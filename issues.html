                  <h2>Report a Bug</h2>

                  <p>The best way to report a bug is with the <a href=
                  "https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/bugs/">bug report
                  tool</a> on the MrBayes Sourceforge project page.
                  With this tool one can look at previously reported
                  bugs. Here you can chose different filters to select
                  only those bug reports that satisfy you search
                  criteria. If the problem you have encountered is not
                  listed here, you can submit a new bugreport by
                  clicking the <a href=
                  "https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/bugs/new/">Create
                  Ticket</a> link.</p>

                  <h3>Submit a new bug</h3><!-- 
      <p style="text-align:center"><img  src="images/bugTraker.jpg" alt="screenshot" style="border: 1px black solid;"></p>
      <p style="text-align:center">A screen shot of the bug report tool.</p>
 -->

                  <p>On the bug report page there are a few optional
                  choices:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><em>Category</em>: Where did the bug appear,
                    e.g. in the MPI part.</li>

                    <li><em>Group</em>: In which version of MrBayes did
                    the bug appear, e.g. version 3.2 or earliar. Note
                    however that we discontinue fixing bugs for
                    versions earlier than 3.2 (3.1 or earlier). The bug
                    report about version before 3.2 is only useful as
                    information to other users outlining the bug. If
                    you have problems with version before 3.2, please
                    try MrBayes 3.2 and if the problem persist, report
                    it as a bug of version 3.2.</li>

                    <li><em>Private</em>: is a visibility flag. When it
                    marked your post will be visible only to
                    administrators (developers of Mrbayes) and not to
                    the general public.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>In the mandatory fields <em>Summary</em> and
                  <em>Description</em> you can describe the bug. Keep
                  in mind that the <b>only</b> way for us to solve the
                  bug is if <b>we can repeat it</b>. See for example,
                  the article <a href=
                  "http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">
                  How to Report Bugs Effectively</a>.</p>

                  <p>The bug tool allows you to attach files to your
                  bug report. You can find this upload option at the
                  end of the report page.</p>

                  <p>We would very much appreciate if you can send us
                  nexus file which on its execution courses the problem
                  that you describe in your bug report. Nexus file much
                  like a picture may worth thousands of words. Please
                  specify after how many generation you encountered the
                  problem if it is applicable. It would be even more
                  kind of you if you could provide a log file
                  containing the whole output of the run. If resulting
                  log file is too big you can cat out routine printout
                  of likelihood, leaving the beginning of the run where
                  analyze is set up and the final (crash) messages. If
                  you have multiple files to send you should pack them
                  first into one by tar, zip or any other commonly used
                  compression program.</p>

                  <p>If instead of using release version of MrBayes you
                  are using development version from the trunk, then
                  please specify which release you are using. The
                  release number is printed after latter 'r' on the
                  first line printed by MrBayes when it started. The
                  first line may look like this 'MrBayes
                  v3.2-svn(r456)', which means that you have release
                  number 456. Also if you compiled MrBayes with
                  non-default options then please let us know what they
                  were.</p>

                  <p>When you are satisfied with your report, you can
                  submit it by pressing the <em>Save</em> button.
                  Although Sourceforge asks you to login, you don't
                  have to. The bug report will then be filled
                  anonymously, but you might want to add your e-mail
                  address in the report, so we can contact you if
                  further details are needed.</p>
