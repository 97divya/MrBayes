  <h2>Reporting a Bug</h2>

  <p><em>NOTE:</em> Bug reporting is being moved over from SourceForge
  to GitHub. This move is on ongoing project. This means that the info
  on this page regarding the SourceForge bug tracker is out of date. It
  will be updated when the old bug tickets have been migrated to GitHub
  issues</p>

  <p>The best way to report a bug is with the <a href=
  "https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/bugs/">bug report tool</a> on the
  MrBayes Sourceforge project page. With this tool one can look at
  previously reported bugs. Here you can chose different filters to
  select only those bug reports that satisfy you search criteria. If
  the problem you have encountered is not listed here, you can submit a
  new bugreport by clicking the <a href=
  "https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/bugs/new/">Create Ticket</a>
  link.</p>

  <h3>Submit a new bug</h3>

  <p>On the bug report page there are a few optional choices:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><em>Category</em>: Where did the bug appear, e.g. in the MPI
      part.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><em>Group</em>: In which version of MrBayes did the bug
      appear, e.g. version 3.2 or earliar. Note however that we
      discontinue fixing bugs for versions earlier than 3.2 (3.1 or
      earlier). The bug report about version before 3.2 is only useful
      as information to other users outlining the bug. If you have
      problems with version before 3.2, please try MrBayes 3.2 and if
      the problem persist, report it as a bug of version 3.2.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><em>Private</em>: is a visibility flag. When it marked your
      post will be visible only to administrators (developers of
      Mrbayes) and not to the general public.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the mandatory fields <em>Summary</em> and <em>Description</em>
  you can describe the bug. Keep in mind that the <b>only</b> way for
  us to solve the bug is if <b>we can repeat it</b>. See for example,
  the article <a href=
  "http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">How to Report
  Bugs Effectively</a>.</p>

  <p>The bug tool allows you to attach files to your bug report. You
  can find this upload option at the end of the report page.</p>

  <p>We would very much appreciate if you can send us nexus file which
  on its execution courses the problem that you describe in your bug
  report. Nexus file much like a picture may worth thousands of words.
  Please specify after how many generation you encountered the problem
  if it is applicable. It would be even more kind of you if you could
  provide a log file containing the whole output of the run. If
  resulting log file is too big you can cat out routine printout of
  likelihood, leaving the beginning of the run where analyze is set up
  and the final (crash) messages. If you have multiple files to send
  you should pack them first into one by tar, zip or any other commonly
  used compression program.</p>

  <p>If instead of using release version of MrBayes you are using
  development version from the trunk, then please specify which release
  you are using. The release number is printed after latter 'r' on the
  first line printed by MrBayes when it started. The first line may
  look like this 'MrBayes v3.2-svn(r456)', which means that you have
  release number 456. Also if you compiled MrBayes with non-default
  options then please let us know what they were.</p>

  <p>Later versions (&gt;3.2.6 only) of MrBayes have an extended
  "Version" command that displays not only the version of the software,
  but also what features it was compiled with, what type of host the
  software was compiled for, as well as the vendor and version of the
  compiler that was used. This information would be useful in any bug
  report.</p>

  <p>When you are satisfied with your report, you can submit it by
  pressing the <em>Save</em> button. Although Sourceforge asks you to
  login, you don't have to. The bug report will then be filled
  anonymously, but you might want to add your e-mail address in the
  report, so we can contact you if further details are needed.</p>

  <h2>Mailing list</h2>

  <p>A great aid for resolving problems with MrBayes is the MrBayes
  <a href=
  "https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mrbayes-users">mailing
  list</a>. If you have a general question about MrBayes you can ask it
  by posting the question to the mailing list. To post on this list you
  have to be subscribed to it. The <a href=
  "https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/mailman/mrbayes-users/">list
  archive</a> is accessible for everyone.</p>
