This website is work in progress!

It is currently being moved over from its old home at SourceForge.

It is a set of static pages.
Create them using `make -C _build`.
Clean them with `make -C _build clean`

TODO:
* When bugs are migrated to GitHub issues, update issues links.
* Mailing list, likewise.
