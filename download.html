  <h2>Current release</h2>

  <p>Current version of MrBayes is 3.2.6, released November 25, 2015.
  All downloads of MrBayes are managed through the MrBayes download
  page on SourceForge. You can download executable versions for
  <a href="http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/download2.php?arch=win">Windows
  (32bit and 64bit)</a>, and <a href=
  "http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/download2.php?arch=mac">Macintosh
  (64bit)</a> computers, as well as the <a href=
  "http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/download2.php?arch=src">source
  code</a> for compilation on Unix machines. The Mac installer includes
  both the serial and parallel (MPI) version of the program, while the
  Windows installer only includes the serial version; both include the
  BEAGLE library (v2.1). The serial version works well for smaller
  analyses but if you plan to run large analyses using many parallel
  chains, you should use the MPI version instead. Refer to the <a href=
  "manual.html">User Manual</a> for help with installation of the
  program.</p>

  <h2>Older releases</h2>

  <p>You can get access to older releases from <a href=
  "https://sourceforge.net/projects/mrbayes/files/mrbayes/">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>Developer version</h2>

  <p>You may also download cutting edge <a href=
  "https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/code/HEAD/tree/">developer
  version</a> of MrBayes from the svn repository hosted at sourceforge.
  Note that you have to compile the code yourself. Read instructions in
  README file in the root directory of the svn repository for further
  instructions.</p>

  <h2>Mailing List</h2>

  <p>A great aid for resolving problems with MrBayes is the MrBayes
  <a href=
  "https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mrbayes-users">mailing
  list</a>. If you have a question about MrBayes you can ask it by
  posting the question to the mailing list. To post on this list you
  have to be subscribed to it. However, the <a href=
  "https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/mailman/mrbayes-users/">list
  archive</a> is accessible to everyone.</p>

  <p>The list will also be used by the MrBayes authors for
  announcements of new versions or bugfixes. We, therefore, recommend
  that you subscribe to the list if you are a regular MrBayes user.</p>
